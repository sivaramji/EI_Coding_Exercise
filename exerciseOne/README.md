### # Exercise 1 
## Design Patterns 

What is it? any resuable solution or blueprint. An idea to adapt. 

Quick summary - 
1. Creational - how objects are created
2. Structural - how objects combine
3. Behavioural - how objects communicate

These patterns need to be _reusable_ , _standard_ ( for e.g. with comments to understand ), _efficient_ (dont solve same problem twice), _flexible_ 

## 1. Creational Pattern 
1. Factory - single factory (class) that makes 'similar' objects. Order anything you want from this factory, not the particular class itself. 
2. Abstract - when you want to order a factory that has similar objects. e.g. mac and windows, both needs buttons (same function) - but comes from different factory. 
3. Builder - step by step process instead of as a whole. => Can use when we customize a lot. 
4. Prototype - make a copy of what's there already. (like ctrl+D)
5. Singleton - only one instance ALWAYS. 

--> Use cases are explained in the README files of respective design pattern's folder. 

## 2. Structural Pattern
